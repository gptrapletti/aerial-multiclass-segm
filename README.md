# Aerial Semantic Segmentation

![drone_cover_image](data/aerial_drone.jpg)

## Introduction
This deep learning project aims to segment aerial images captured by drones. The focus is on multiclass segmentation to categorize different features in these high-resolution images.

## Repository structure
Below are outlined the contents of the repository.
- `configs`: Hydra configuration files, used for setting up and managing configurations in a structured manner, facilitating the customization and adjustment of various parameters during the model trainingâ€‹.
- `data`: aerial drone photography images and their segmentation masks.
- `notebooks`: notebooks for data exploration and some augmentations tests.
- `src`: source code for training.
- `train.py`: training script.
- some preprocessing and utility scripts.

## Data
The dataset consists of 400 aerial photographs of urban areas from drone, featuring people, buildings, cars, streets, trees, vegetation, lakes, etc. The images come with corresponding semantic segmentation masks.
